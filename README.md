# iWatched

iWatched is a website which allows it's users to save a list of all the movies and shows they have watched and have a top 10 movies and shows list that they can share with their friends.

The project is build on Node.js using Express as my server handler.   
I am using MongoDB to store all data and communicate with it using the mongoose module.  
The login system is build with passport.js and i have future plans of implementing oAuth so users can login with facebook and google.
